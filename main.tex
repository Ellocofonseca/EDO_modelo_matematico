%%% Here is the class with everything we need, if you don't want, you don't have to take a look at it, as it will probably cover your needs by far. These three options are used after the class article, which this template is based in.
% Twoside will act as an special parameter, because if the document is twosided indeed, headers and footers will be adapted in consequence.
% I recently added the language parameter to change it more easily, so the label of all theorems are redefined accordingly, depending on which is used. Disclaimer: only available for Catalan, English and Spanish. If no language is selected, English is enforced.
